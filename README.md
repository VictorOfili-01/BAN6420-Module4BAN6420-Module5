As a Data analyst at the Anderson Cancer Center, I was tasked with developing a model to address the growing number of referrals at the center.

This model's first step is to identify essential variables for securing donor funding.

After consulting with your team, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) has been chosen as the most suitable technique for this task. 

Specifically, I am required to perform the following task:

Utilize Principal Component Analysis to demonstrate how essential variables can be acquired from the bc_data dataset

Reduce the dataset into 2 PCA components for the project
